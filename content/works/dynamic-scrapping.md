Script i made with python that you enter if the site has pagination or not 


if not, it scrapp one site (the url you entered) , if it had a pagniation 


you enter the url and replace pagniation page number with "$i" 


then you enter your elments with format -> "element.classname->attr" 


for example : if i want to get all images that had class player-image i will enter it like that 


"img.player-image->src"


and finally it save your data in csv file
