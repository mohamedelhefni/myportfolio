Darkhub is a github clone i used github api as a backend and React.js for front end  
i used React Hooks to make project functionality .


you can search using user name and get his repos


i used [materilizecss](https://materializecss.com/) for front end and i added some custom css to make it seem better


the site is fully responsive with pure css media query


you can see live preview for it in the link below:
