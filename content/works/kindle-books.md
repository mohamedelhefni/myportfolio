A website that allows you to search on about 8000 e-book 


there are various types like: mobi, epub, azw3, kfx , pdf


you can save the book on your favorites and download it later 


I used Tailwindcss of ui and vue.js on front-end deployed on netlify 


for the back-end I used Python (Flask) and mysql as a database 


I stored the books on drive using drive api 


the back-end is deployed on heroku
