NamaaOnline is a multi-lingual website built using the Laravel framework. Laravel’s built-in localization features make it easy to support multiple languages, allowing us to provide a seamless user experience for our diverse user base. The website’s front-end is designed using TailwindCSS, a modern CSS framework that enables us to create clean and responsive user interfaces.

In addition to Laravel and TailwindCSS, we also use Alpine.js to add reactivity to our front-end code. Alpine.js is a lightweight JavaScript framework that allows us to build interactive components without the need for a full-fledged front-end framework. This keeps our codebase lean and easy to maintain while still providing a rich user experience.

Overall, our technology stack enables us to deliver a fast and reliable platform for booking doctor visits online. Our use of modern web development tools and best practices ensures that NamaaOnline is scalable, secure, and easy to use.
